      <h3>CLAIRE CONNACHAN</h3><p>
      All the cool kids have their own amateur-looking websites these days, complete with waxwork Arnies.
      <p>
      I include this photo because I mentioned that I love Arnie to the entire E20 cohort.
      <p>
      This photo was taken when I went to dinner with Arnie. Tickets were £200 and he sat about fifteen tables away from me. The real Arnie that is, not this waxwork one. This waxwork Arnie was about ten tables away from me. I'm not sure there's a better way to spend £200 if I'm completely honest.
      <p>
      My favourite Arnie film is Terminator 2. I also like Predator. Although the best line in Predator is "I ain't got time to bleed", it isn't an Arnie line but I think it's a good motto for life regardless.
      <p>
      Anyway, enough about Arnie. Check out my <a href="skills.html">skills</a> and some <a href="testimonials.html">testimomials</a> from people (not Arnie).
